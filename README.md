# public-health-nonprofit-program-funding
Final Project for the Promineo Tech Backend Bootcamp

### Brief Description:

This repository contains all process documents, code, and documentation for my final project as part of Promineo Tech's Feb. 2023 Backend Developer cohort. The goal of the project was to create a MySQL database and corresponding API endpoints with fully implemented CRUD operations. It is coded primarily in Java using the Spring Boot framework, and I used Gradle as the build-tool.

The database architecture is meant to reflect organizational tracking of funding sources for a fictional nonprofit focusing on Public Health. I came up with this idea in consultation with my endlessly loving, hard-working, beautiful wife Liz, who is a program manager for a public health nonprofit (...when she's not working overnight as a bedside nurse). This project, not to mention my career as a developer, would not exist without her support.
